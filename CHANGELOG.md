# Changelog

All notable changes. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). A change to a default is called out under **Changed defaults**.

## 0.1.0-rc.1 (release candidate)

The first public release candidate. `v0.1.0` follows two weeks of daily use and the hand checks in `docs/release-checklist.md`.

### What it is

- A Claude Code plugin (the main lock) that hides secrets in everything the model would see: typed and pasted prompts, files Claude reads, `@` files, command output, connected tools' results, subagents' work, project instruction files, injected context and compaction summaries.
- A backup lock (settings hooks, needs Node) that takes over when the main lock is not alive.
- Registered secrets in the OS password store, `/redact add`, `learn` and `allow`, an outbound check on commands and web requests, an overwrite guard, observe mode, optional personal-data hiding, and a self-protection check.
- The leak test kit, the `/redact self-check` and `/redact doctor` commands, published scores and tested versions.

### Defaults

`mode: enforce`, `outbound: block`, `on_check_failure: allow` (with a warning), `media: pass`, `personal_data: off`, `hints: on`, `notices: on`, `secret_files: .env*`, `log.days: 30`. These are the first defaults; any later change is listed here.

### Known limits

See `docs/spec.md` section 22 and the README. The main ones: secrets with no known shape, content sent before the tool was installed, Claude Code's own disk records, and **Claude Code's built-in guard**, which on a machine with managed settings or a managed MCP server file, or with a Team or Enterprise login, routes some events past a user-installed plugin (under `on_check_failure: hold` the plugin refuses the request). Only the organization install (`docs/managed.md`) avoids it.

### Name

The working name was `secret-shield`. NoCreds was the first final choice; the name is AegisContext (plugin `aegiscontext`, settings key `aegisContext`, data folder and store service `aegiscontext`). Nothing was published under an earlier name.
