# Release checklist

For the maintainer. The tool never merges or tags by itself.

## Before the release candidate (`v0.1.0-rc.1`)

- [ ] `develop` is green in CI on the three systems, including `leak-test:org`, `leak-test:guarded` and `leak-test:guarded-hold`.
- [ ] `docs/spec.md` section 22 lists the doors `leak-test:guarded` measured (`GUARDED_OPEN` in `tools/leak-test/org.ts`).
- [ ] The versions agree: `package.json`, `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugin/hooks/marker.ts`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
- [ ] `docs/tested-versions.md` and `docs/scores.md` are current for this release.
- [ ] Private vulnerability reporting is on (`gh api repos/Mrinanka/aegiscontext/private-vulnerability-reporting` says `enabled`): `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and the issue template link to it.
- [ ] `npm run release:pack` on a clean tree (see below).
- [ ] The merge of `develop` into `release`; `release` is the repository's default branch.
- [ ] `v0.1.0-rc.1` tagged by the maintainer on the tip of `release` (the README install job refuses any other commit). The release workflow runs CI and makes a **draft** release.

## Before `v0.1.0`

Not done by the tool; they need the maintainer, a real key, or a real app.

- [ ] Two weeks of daily use by the maintainer.
- [ ] Hand checks in the interactive terminal: `/resume` at `prompt.submit`, the `/redact add` and `learn` panes, the `outbound: ask` dialog, the observe banner, whether `/redact` survives `/clear`.
- [ ] Hand checks in **VS Code** (the extension's own Claude Code version) and the **desktop app's Code tab** (record its Claude Code version). The probe log of the desktop app had no start line, so its version was never recorded.
- [ ] The optional **real-API run**: the same doors against the real API, with a real key and network. It stays out of the kit.
- [ ] A trademark register search for "AegisContext" (USPTO, EUIPO). Only npm, GitHub and the web were searched.
- [ ] Reports to Anthropic for the items in spec section 22 ("Claude Code's own disk records") and the `claude plugin test` `HookStream.result` behaviour.
- [ ] The directory submission, if wanted.

## Cutting the archives

```
npm run release:pack -- v0.1.0-rc.1
```

It refuses a dirty tree or a tag that does not match the version, makes the `.tar.gz` and `.zip` with `git archive`, and writes `SHA256SUMS`. Verify with `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS` (macOS: `shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS`; Windows: `Get-FileHash`).
