# Personal mode: install, settings, uninstall

For one developer on their own computer. Administrators: [managed.md](managed.md).

## Install

1. In Claude Code: `/plugin install aegiscontext --marketplace Mrinanka/aegiscontext` (Claude Code 2.1.309 or later).
2. Restart the session.
3. Run `/redact doctor`. It lists the Claude Code version, the plugin's tier, the built-in guard, the password store, the backup lock, Node, the marker and the settings, and says what to fix.

A plugin from a marketplace sits in the `user` tier. Other plugins in a higher tier run first and could skip it, and a few switches turn it off silently: `--safe-mode`, `--bare`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE=1`, a project's `disableAllHooks`, and an organization's `allowManagedHooksOnly`. When the hooks do not run, `/redact` does not exist; `/aegiscontext:doctor` still does, and says so.

**On a machine with managed settings or a managed MCP server file, or with a Team or Enterprise login,** Claude Code seats its own guard first and routes instruction files, hook context, skill text, attachments and compaction summaries past a user plugin. Any one of those is enough. The plugin warns once per session and `/redact doctor` shows it. Under `on_check_failure: hold` it refuses every request instead, because it cannot check what would be sent. See [managed.md](managed.md) for the install that avoids it.

## The backup lock

Settings hooks that run the same checker with Node and take over when the main lock is not alive. Node must be on the PATH.

1. Run `/redact backup`. It copies the backup lock to `<Claude folder>/aegiscontext/backup/` and prints the settings.
2. Paste the settings into `~/.claude/settings.json` (merge the `hooks` block if you have one). The snippet is [snippets/personal.json](snippets/personal.json).
3. Run `/redact doctor`: it should find the hooks and a current copy.

It blocks a prompt that holds a secret whole, checks a tool's call before it runs, and cleans a tool's output. It does **not** cover `@` files, a failed command's error, a compaction summary, a resumed session's history, project `CLAUDE.md` text or settings-hook context. A later session refreshes an existing copy; it never makes one unasked.

## Register your own secrets

- `/redact add [--label name]` opens a box. The value is never on the command line. (If you type it after the command, it is refused, but it was typed: rotate it.)
- `/redact learn` lists the values in files matching `secret_files` (default `.env*`); tick the ones to remember.
- Saved values live in your operating system's password store (Keychain, Secret Service, or DPAPI-encrypted files on Windows).
- `/redact allow <tag>` marks a hidden value as harmless; `--always` remembers that.

## Settings

All optional, under an `aegisContext` key in `~/.claude/settings.json` (User), the managed settings (Managed) or the project's `.claude/settings.json` (Project: can only make things stricter).

| Setting | Default | Options |
|---|---|---|
| `mode` | `enforce` | `enforce`, `observe` |
| `personal_data` | `off` | `on`, `off` |
| `outbound` | `block` | `block`, `ask`, `warn`, `off` |
| `on_check_failure` | `allow` (with warning) | `allow`, `hold` |
| `media` | `pass` (with notice) | `pass`, `drop` |
| `hints` | `on` | `on`, `off` |
| `notices` | `on` | `on`, `off` |
| `rules.off` | none | Rule ids to switch off |
| `rules.custom` | none | Extra patterns, each with a label and a keyword |
| `rules.actions` | `hide` for all | Per rule: `hide`, `warn`, `block` |
| `allow` | none | Values or patterns that are harmless |
| `secret_files` | `.env*` | File patterns treated as secret |
| `log.days` | `30` | Number of days |

`observe` hides nothing and logs what it would have hidden, behind a permanent banner: use it to trial the tool and tune false alarms before `enforce`. `hold` stops a request when a check cannot finish; `allow` lets it through with a warning.

## Where things live

The Claude folder is `~/.claude`, or the folder `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` names. AegisContext keeps its files in `<Claude folder>/aegiscontext/`: `log/` (labels, tags and redacted text only; emptied after `log.days`), `markers/`, `reports/`, `backup/` and, on Windows, `store/` (encrypted files).

## Uninstall

1. `/plugin uninstall aegiscontext`.
2. If you installed the backup lock, remove its three hooks (`UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`) from `~/.claude/settings.json`, and any `aegisContext` key.
3. Delete the saved secrets. Removing the plugin leaves them in your password store on purpose; they are yours. The store holds items with the service name `aegiscontext`: one item named `index` and one per piece named `list-<generation>-<n>`.

   **macOS** (Keychain). This removes the saved items, then the AegisContext folder inside your Claude folder (a small marker file stays there after the items go, and the plugin cannot delete a file):

   ```
   while security delete-generic-password -s aegiscontext >/dev/null 2>&1; do :; done; rm -rf "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/aegiscontext"
   ```

   **Linux** (Secret Service; needs `secret-tool` from libsecret-tools). The same two steps:

   ```
   secret-tool clear service aegiscontext; rm -rf "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/aegiscontext"
   ```

   **Windows** (the values are DPAPI-encrypted files; remove the folder, using your Claude folder if you moved it):

   ```
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\aegiscontext"
   ```

   All three also remove the log, the backup lock copy and the reports. CI runs these commands against the real stores.
