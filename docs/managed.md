# Managed mode: install for an organization

For an administrator who rolls AegisContext out to many machines. The plugin then runs in the `prepend` tier, outermost: no user plugin can skip it, a user cannot switch it off, and settings can be locked.

## Why not just let people install it

Two reasons:

1. **The built-in guard.** On a machine with managed settings or a managed MCP server file, or with a Team or Enterprise login (any one is enough), Claude Code seats a guard plugin (`sec-default@builtin`) outermost and routes some events past user-tier plugins: instruction files, hook context, skill text, attachments, the instructions note, compaction, and some rows. A user-installed copy cannot close that; under `on_check_failure: hold` it refuses every request instead. The organization install can, because `prependPlugins` lets you seat AegisContext outside the guard. `npm run leak-test:guarded` measures what the guard passes over; `npm run leak-test:org` proves the organization install leaves nothing open (both run in CI).
2. **Only a folder marketplace reaches `prepend`.** A plugin fetched from GitHub or a git URL counts as a user's. The marketplace must be a folder on each machine, with the plugin entry given as a relative path.

## What you need on each machine

1. **A marketplace folder** holding the release: verify a release archive (`aegiscontext-<tag>.tar.gz` or `.zip`) against `SHA256SUMS`, then unpack it into a folder of your choice, for example `/opt` (macOS, Linux) or `C:\Program Files\AegisContext` (Windows). The archive holds one folder, `aegiscontext-<tag>` (for example `aegiscontext-v0.1.0-rc.1`), and **that folder is the marketplace folder**: it holds `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and `plugin/`. A path one level off loads no plugin and shows no error on screen, so run the check below on one machine first.
2. **Managed settings** that name the folder, enable the plugin, and list it first in `prependPlugins`: [snippets/managed-plugin.json](snippets/managed-plugin.json), with `<MARKETPLACE-FOLDER>` replaced by the full path of that folder:

   ```json
   {
     "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
       "aegiscontext": { "source": { "source": "directory", "path": "<MARKETPLACE-FOLDER>" } }
     },
     "enabledPlugins": { "aegiscontext@aegiscontext": true },
     "prependPlugins": ["aegiscontext@aegiscontext", "sec-default@builtin"]
   }
   ```

   Keep `sec-default@builtin` in `prependPlugins`, after the plugin: a `prependPlugins` list replaces Claude Code's default seat for the guard, so leaving it out would remove the guard.
3. **The backup lock** (recommended): settings hooks with `onFailure: "block"`, so a hook that cannot start stops the call: [snippets/managed.json](snippets/managed.json). Node must be on the PATH. Copy `plugin/backup/` to a folder whose path contains `aegiscontext` and point `main.js` at it. Add `--policy <file>` only when your settings arrive by MDM or from the server, which a process cannot read; the file is a copy of that policy.
4. **AegisContext settings** under the `aegisContext` key of the same managed settings, with `locked` naming the settings users cannot change. Recommended: `"on_check_failure": "hold"` and `"locked": ["mode", "on_check_failure", "outbound"]`.

Put these in the managed settings location for the system:

| System | Managed settings file |
|---|---|
| macOS | `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json` |
| Linux, WSL | `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json` |
| Windows | `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json` |

or deliver them by MDM (Jamf, Intune) or from the Claude server. For an offline site the release archive is the whole thing. An internal git mirror of the repo does **not** reach the `prepend` tier; it serves the Personal install only.

## Trial it

1. Run the leak test kit on one test machine ([verify.md](verify.md)): `npm run leak-test:org`.
2. Roll out with `"mode": "observe"` to a small group and read the log for false alarms. A permanent banner says nothing is hidden.
3. Tune with `allow` and `rules.off`.
4. Switch to `enforce`.

## Check a machine

Run `/redact doctor` on it. It should say Managed settings are present, show the plugin tier as `prepend`, and say the events reach the plugin. If `/redact` does not exist, the plugin did not load: check that `<MARKETPLACE-FOLDER>` is the folder that holds `.claude-plugin/`.

## Limits

Safe mode turns the main lock off even here; a backup lock installed through managed settings still runs in safe mode. The full list is section 22 of the spec.
