// The kit's guarded and organization modes (plan step 6, spec §5.3 and §22).
//
//   --guarded  the tool loaded as a user plugin on a machine with a real managed settings file. Claude Code's
//              built-in guard (`sec-default@builtin`) seats itself outermost there and passes some events past
//              user-tier mods. The kit measures which doors that opens; GUARDED_OPEN lists them, and the run
//              fails if a listed door is clean or any other door leaks, so the limit in spec §22 stays true.
//              With --hold, the managed file sets on_check_failure: hold, and the same doors must be refused.
//   --org      the organization install: a folder marketplace on the machine, the plugin enabled by managed
//              settings and named in `prependPlugins`, so it runs in the outermost tier. Every door must be clean.
//
// Both write the machine's managed settings file, so they run in CI only (D-020). Each run's debug log is the
// proof that the tool sat in the tier under test, and that the pass-over warning came where it must and nowhere
// else; a log without that proof makes the run invalid, never clean.
